# question-box

This project runs on Heroku: https://quiet-retreat-14165.herokuapp.com/login/
as well as the local server. This application is a clone of the popular site, Stack Overflow. A user has the ability to create a profile and log in. After that, a user can post a question or answer a question. A user also has the ability to up vote or down vote questions and answers. A user gets points based on how many questions they've asked, if their answer gets up voted, if their answer gets down voted, and if they down vote an answer. A user's score can be seen on their profile page.

It is also possible to navigate to a user's page and see their score and the questions they've asked. There is also a question detail page when a user clicks on a question and the app will navigate to see details about that question like answers and up votes and down votes.

It is not possible to ask a question, answer, up vote, or down vote without being logged in.
